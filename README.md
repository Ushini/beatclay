A smart bracelet making moving to music more engaging. This device was built to enhance an audience's collective interaction with a live coding performance. By aggregating and mapping accelerometer and gyroscope data to tempo and volume parameters in the live coding environment, the audience can drive elements of the music in real-time. The device also aims to create engaging interaction within audience members, as the level of synchronicity in their movements affect the intensity of the effects in the music.
